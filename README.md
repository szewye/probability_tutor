# Probability Tutor

The probability tutor tool is an interactive resource that aims to teach users about the fundamental concepts of probability theory, with a particular focus on the Monty Hall problem, Bayes' theorem, and conditional probability. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to learn about probability theory through interactive examples, exercises, and simulations.
